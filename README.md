#### Frame Consistency Visualization
Abstract: *A video analysis tool for inspecting frame consistency through a sequence of images.*

### Packages

`os` `numpy` `opencv` `scipy`

### Requirements

- Both Linux and Windows are supported. Linux is recommended for performance and compatibility reasons.
- 64-bit Python 3.7.9 installation. We recommend Anaconda3 with numpy 1.19.1 or newer.

### Dataset
To  evaluate our proposed tool, we used the Vimeo90K dataset collected from the MIT CSAIL which contains around 90,000 7-frame HR sequences with a fixed resolution (448 x 256), extracted from 39K video clips from Vimeo.com.
